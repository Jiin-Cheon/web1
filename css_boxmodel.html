    <h1>Fashion</h1> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion">Fashion</a> is a form of self-expression and autonomy at a particular period and
    place and in a specific context, of clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle,
    and body posture.[1] The term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is
    trending. Everything that is considered fashion is available and popularized by the fashion system
    (industry and media).</p>
    <p>Due to increased mass-production of commodities and clothing at lower prices and global reach,
      sustainability has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands, and consumers.[2][3]</p>
